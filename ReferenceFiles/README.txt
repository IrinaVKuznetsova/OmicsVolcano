The “ReferenceFiles” are input files to support the processes that are part of OmicsVolcano, they are not demonstration files and therefore they will not work as practice files for plot visualization. 


Mitochondrial Process reference files were accessed from MitoXplorer (Yim et al. 2019) and combined with MitoCarta 2.0 0 (Calvo et al. 2015; Pagliarini et al. 2008)

Cellular Compartment Localizations reference files for Human genome were accessed from https://www.proteinatlas.org/ (Thul et al. 2017)
